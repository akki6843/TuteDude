# ASSIGNMENT 2:  
## Module 3: Control Structures in Python  
 
### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd  
#### Problem Statement:  Write a Python program that:  

1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.  
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.  
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.  

#### Solution :   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code is available in `Task1.py` file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On executing it. you will be promoted for inputs after which code will tell if the provided input is ODD or EVEN.

 
### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop  
#### Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.  
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.  
3.   Displays the final sum.  

#### Solution :   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code is available in `Task2.py` file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On executing it. code will give sum from 1 to 50. It can also be modified to collect input from a user and give sum.
