# ASSIGNMENT 3:  
## Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python   
### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
#### Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:  
1.   Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2.   Returns the calculated factorial.
3.   Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

#### Solution :   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code is available in `Task1.py` file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On executing it. you will be asked for a input, providing one will give factorial of the number.



### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
#### Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Asks the user for a number as input.
2.   Uses the math module to calculate the:   
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Square root of the number  
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

#### Solution :   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The code is available in `Task2.py` file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On executing it. you will be asked for a input, providing one will give 3 print statements each giving one solution as requested.
